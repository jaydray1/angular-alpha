Learning Angular 4 using the Angular Tutorial and other online resources
This readme will be updated as the project continues. I will include:
1. Full CRUD 
2. API usage
3. Angular JS best practices per the docs
4. OAuth or Firebase authentication
5. Third-party library
6. Deployed - I've been using Digital Ocean but I'd like to use AWS for this one

Let's do this!
